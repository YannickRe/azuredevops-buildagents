# DevOps Build Agents
This project generates self-hosted build agents based on the [official Microsoft-hosted build agents images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images), in an Azure DevOps Pipeline. The resulting Azure Managed Image will be associated to the existing Virtual Machine Scale Set so that new VM's will be using the newly generated image.  This Virtual Machine Scale Set is managed by Azure DevOps as a [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5003400#azure-virtual-machine-scale-set-agents).

Currently supports Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, Ubuntu 2004 and Ubuntu 2204 images.

## Available pipelines
- __[buildagent-generation.yml](./buildagent-generation.yml)__  
  - Checkout the latest `main` branch from [actions/runner-images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images)
  - Build the VM with Packer  
  - Clean up remaining temporary Azure resources  
  - Turn VM disk into Azure Managed Image  
  - Add Azure Managed Image to Azure Compute Gallery and remove Azure Managed Image
- __[managedimage-cleanup.yml](./managedimage-cleanup.yml)__  
  - Remove unused Azure Managed Images

## Preparation
The pipeline requires Azure resources for the temporary building of the VM image, Azure resources for running the resulting Agent Pool, and some configuration in Azure DevOps.

## Azure Compute Gallery
Create (if you donÂ´t have one) an Azure Computer Gallery in your Azure subscription, and create the following VM Image Defenitions:
- ubuntu2004-agentpool-full (OS: Linux)
- ubuntu2204-agentpool-full (OS: Linux)
- windows2019-agentpool-full (OS: Windows)
- windows2022-agentpool-full (OS: Windows)  

This step will be automated in a later stage.

### Azure Resources for Packer execution
The Azure resources are created with the [Azure PowerShell Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az?WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5003400)  

1. Connect to Azure
```
Connect-AzAccount -UseDeviceAuthentication
```
2. Create resource group that will store the Packer temporary resources
```
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "DevOps-PackerResources" -Location "West Europe"
```
3. Create an Azure Storage Account to store the generated VHD
```
New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "DevOps-PackerResources" -AccountName "devopspacker" -Location "West Europe" -SkuName "Standard_LRS"
```
4. Create Azure AD Service Principal, output client secret and client id
```
$sp = New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName "DevOps-Packer"
$BSTR = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($sp.Secret)
$plainPassword = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($BSTR)
$plainPassword
$sp.ApplicationId
```
5. Make the Service Principal a Contributor on the subscription
```
New-AzRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Contributor -ServicePrincipalName $sp.ApplicationId
```
6. Make the Service Principal a Storage Blob Data Contributor on the subscription
```
New-AzRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName "Storage Blob Data Contributor" -ServicePrincipalName $sp.ApplicationId
```

### Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set
To use an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set as an Azure DevOps Scale Set Agent it has to adhere to a certain set of requirements. [The documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/scale-set-agents?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5003400#create-the-scale-set) contains all the required information, but at the time of writing the following things were important:
- __VM size__: at least *Standard_D4s_v4*
- __Overprovisioning__: *no*, Azure DevOps will decide whether or not new VM's (and thus Agents) need to be provisioned
- __Upgrade policy__: *manual*

### Azure DevOps Scale Set Agent
The Virtual Machine Scale Set from the previous step needs to be registered as an Agent Pool in Azure DevOps. [The instructions are very clear](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/scale-set-agents?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5003400#create-the-scale-set-agent-pool):
- Add an Agent Pool of type "Azure virtual machine scale set"  
- Use a service connection to select the scale set from the previous step (only supported via `Secret` authentication, not `Certificate` or `Managed Identity` authentication)  
- Give the agent pool a name  
- Enter the required configuration values  

### Azure DevOps Variable Group
Create a Variable Group in the Azure DevOps project running the pipeline, and give it a name. It needs to contain the following variables with their appropriate value:
| Variable  | Description |
|---|---|
| AZURE_AGENTS_RESOURCE_GROUP | Resource Group that contains the Virtual Machine Scale Sets to be used as Scale Set Agents in Azure DevOps |
| AZURE_LOCATION | Azure location where Packer will create the temporary resources |
| AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP | Resource group containing the Azure Storage Account that will be used by Packer. The resulting Azure Managed Image will also be put in this Resource Group |
| AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT | Storage Account that Packer will use to store the temporary OSDisk and the resulting sysprepped .vhd |
| AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION | Subscription ID of the Azure Subscription that is used to host the temporary resources. |
| BUILD_AGENT_VNET_NAME | Name of the existing VNet to use for the VM created by Packer, put $null if you want packer to create a new one |
| BUILD_AGENT_VNET_RESOURCE_GROUP | Name of the resource group containing the existing VNet to use for the VM created by Packer, put $null if you don't have this |
| BUILD_AGENT_SUBNET_NAME | Name of the existing subnet to use for the VM created by Packer, put $null if you don't have this |
| AZURE_TENANT | Tenant ID of the Azure tenant that has the Azure Resource Groups and Subscription. |
| CLIENT_ID | Id of the Azure AD application that has appropriate permissions on the Subscription to create temporary resources and finalizing the Scale Set configuration. See output from scripts above. |
| CLIENT_SECRET | Application secret to be used fot the connection in combination with the Client Id. See output from scripts above. |
| RUN_VALIDATION_FLAG | Wether or not to run a validation on diskspace. Set the value to `false` unless you know what you are doing ;) |
| GALLERY_NAME | (required for option galleryvm) Name of the Azure Compute Gallery to store images for Agent Pool VM Scale Sets.|
| GALLERY_RESOURCE_GROUP| (required for option galleryvm) Name of the resource group containing the Azure Compute Gallery.|

## How to use
### Templated version
Both YML file are designed in a way that allows anyone to simply include them using the "template" instruction. You will need to create a service connection under your Azure DevOps instance before moving with the configuration. 

Assuming the service connection has been setup, under your own repository, within an Azure Pipeline YML file, include the following resource: 

```
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: azuredevops-buildagents
      type: github
      name: YannickRe/azuredevops-buildagents
      endpoint: <your-service-connection-name>
      ref: refs/heads/main
```

This will tell your pipeline that you're dependent upon this repository. Then, the following instructions can be freely customized to your needs. If you need some stages to be ran before the steps within this repository, then include them inside your pipeline, then call the desired template from the repository. 

Calling a template is easy as doing the following: 

```
stages:
  - stage: InsertAnyCustomStageHere
    displayName: 'My Stage'
    [...]
  - stage: BuildImage
    displayName: Build Image
    pool:
      name: <agent-pool>
    jobs:
    - template: buildagent-generation-template.yml@azuredevops-buildagents
      parameters: 
        image_type: <image-type>
        variable_group: <variable-group>
        agent_pool: <agent-pool>
        repository_base_path: azuredevops-buildagents
```

### Template parameters
When calling a template, you must provide certain parameters. For reference, please open the file which interests you: 

- __[buildagent-generation.yml](./buildagent-generation.yml)__  
- __[managedimage-cleanup.yml](./managedimage-cleanup.yml)__  

There is one important element you must be aware of: 

- repository_base_path
  - This variable dictactes how the agent should resolve the assets within this repository. When used, two things will happen:
    - First, it will clone the repository resource specified within your YML file, which represents _this_ repository
    - It will also use it to properly resolve the path where this repository resides on your pipeline agent
  - When a remote template is referenced within an Azure Pipeline YML file, it doesn't clone the repository. Providing this parameter will make sure these templates understands they need to clone it before being able to run any of the scripts.

Optional parameter:

- depends_on
  - You can force the jobs within this repository to depend upon your own set of tasks. To use it, simply provide the name of the job which the next job within the template should depend on.

The rest is quite self explanatory. Use the other parameters to provide the remaining required details for building / cleaning the images.

## Good to know
### Packer
[Packer](https://www.packer.io/) is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Important to know: while building the image, Packer will spin up a VM in Azure to run the installation instructions, sys-prep that image after completion and cleanup all the temporary resources.

### Scale Set Agents
Azure virtual machine scale set agents are a form of self-hosted agents that can be autoscaled to meet demands. This elasticity reduces the need to run dedicated agents all the time.

### Pipeline runtime
Generating the images takes a long time, so don't be surprised. A Windows Server 2019 image takes about 6 to 7h's to generate, a Ubuntu 20.04 image takes about 4h's.

### Chicken or the egg
Generating the image through Packer takes longer than 1h (see previous bullet point), and thus can't be run on the free tier of the Microsoft Hosted Agents (limited to 1h runs). It can only be run on the paid tier of the Microsoft Hosted Agent, or it needs an existing self-hosted agent to run.  
In this project, the initial run of the project is done on a paid Microsoft Hosted Agent and then switched over to the newly generated self-hosted agent scale set. At some point this worked, but currently Microsoft is more strictly enforcing the [6 hour](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#capabilities-and-limitations) runtime limit on Microsoft Hosted Agents. This can be worked around by first creating a self hosted Linux build agent using this process and then using the freshly generated agent to create a Windows image, or be setting up a basic self hosted agent first and use that to generate the full blown build agent.  
This might be resolved in the near future when changes are made to the images [regarding .NET runtime installation](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/3809), which should significantly reduce the build time.

## Agent Pool Usage
See documentation for [YAML-based pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2cbrowser&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5003400#choosing-a-pool-and-agent-in-your-pipeline) and [Classic pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/pools-queues?view=azure-devops&tabs=classic%2cbrowser&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-5003400#choosing-a-pool-and-agent-in-your-pipeline)

## Azure CLI access denied error on Windows Host Pool
Please make sure to disable the "Configure VMs to run interactive tests" in your Windows Agent pool setting, otherwise the Azure CLI will generate access denied errors when running a pipeline.
